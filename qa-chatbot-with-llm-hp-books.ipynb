Unterscheidung between different types of potions, such as healing, damage dealing, buffs, debuffs, etc.\nSure! Here are five examples of cool potions in the world of fantasy:\n1. Healing Potion: This is a classic example of a potion that restores health to a character. When consumed, it can restore a set amount of health points, potentially saving a character from death or at least buying them some time to escape danger. The effects of this potion could be temporary, lasting for a few minutes before wearing off, or permanent, giving the character a steady stream of health regeneration until they consume another potion or die.\n2. Damage Dealing Potion: In contrast to the healing potion, this one deals direct damage to enemies. When consumed, it could create a burst of energy that propels a projectile (such as a fireball) towards nearby enemies, dealing significant damage. Alternatively, it could grant the consumer a temporary boost to their attack power, allowing them to land more hits on their foes. Depending on the game's mechanics, this potion could also have secondary effects like increasing the consumer's speed or agility.\n3. Buff Potion: A buff potion grants the consumer a passive bonus to their abilities or stats, improving their overall performance in combat. Examples include increased strength, endurance, or accuracy. These bonuses could last for a short duration or be permanent, depending on the game's design. Players might use these potions strategically during battles to gain an advantage over their opponents.\n4. Debuff Potion: Conversely, a debuff potion hinders an enemy's abilities or stats, making them less formidable in combat. For instance, it could reduce an enemy's attack power, increase their vulnerability to certain elemental attacks, or even cause them to become confused or disoriented. Like buff potions, debuff potions could have varying durations or be permanent, depending on the game's mechanics.\n5. Elemental Resistance Potion: This potion provides protection against specific elements, such as fire, ice, lightning, or poison. When consumed, it grants the consumer resistance to those elements, reducing the damage they take from them. This could be especially useful in situations where the player is facing a large number of enemies with elemental attacks, as they would be able to shrug off more damage without taking as much harm.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\nloader = DirectoryLoader(CFG.PDFs_path,\n                        glob='./*.pdf',\n                        loader_cls=PyPDFLoader,\n                        show_progress=True,\n                        use_multithreading=True)\n\ndocuments = loader.load()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-04T06:30:29.756831Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-04T06:30:29.757231Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-04T06:32:40.481536Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-04T06:30:29.757191Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-04T06:32:40.480504Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"100%|██████████| 7/7 [02:10<00:00, 18.66s/it]","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"CPU times: user 2min 9s, sys: 1.64 s, total: 2min 11s\nWall time: 2min 10s\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"len(documents)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-04T07:04:49.321312Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-04T07:04:49.321748Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-04T07:04:49.331395Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-04T07:04:49.321714Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-04T07:04:49.330243Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"execution_count":31,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"4114"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(documents[3].page_content)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-04T07:05:15.256390Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-04T07:05:15.256792Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-04T07:05:15.263667Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-04T07:05:15.256760Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-04T07:05:15.262606Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"3\"HELLO?

The Bubbling Cauldron of Confusion - This potion is used to confuse and disorient opponents, making them more vulnerable to attack. It's often used in battle situations to gain an advantage over\nthe enemy.\n3.

It's especially useful during dangerous missions or encounters\nwith dark magic.\n4. The Fizzing Whizbe of Flight - This potion allows the drinker to fly, granting them temporary wings that allow them to soar through the skies. While it may seem like a fun and exciting ability,\nit's important to remember that flying without proper training and precautions can be extremely dangerous.\n5. The Gillywater of Healing - This potion has powerful healing properties, able to mend broken bones, cure diseases, and even bring people back from the brink of death.
